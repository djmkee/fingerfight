    <h2>1. Introduction and Data Controller</h2>
    <p>Finger Fight ("the App") is provided by DevMikeePR. This policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.</p>
    <p>We **do not** collect or store any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number directly through the App. All data collected and processed is handled by third-party services integrated into the App for the purpose of advertising and transaction processing.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection by Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services that collect data:</p>

    <h3>A. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
    <p>The App uses **Google AdMob** to display banner ads and interstitial advertisements. AdMob collects and processes data to serve relevant ads and measure their performance.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type of Data Collected:</strong> Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID), approximate geographic location (based on IP address), and device usage information (e.g., interaction with ads, device type, operating system).</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To serve, target, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h3>
    <p>The App uses the **Google Play Billing Library** to process all in-app purchases and subscriptions (like "Remove Ads" and "Premium Lifetime").</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type of Data Collected:</strong> Transaction details, payment information, and purchase history are collected and processed securely by Google Play.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To facilitate financial transactions and manage user entitlements (e.g., verifying if the user has paid to remove ads).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Safety and Retention</h2>
    <p>We rely on the security and privacy controls provided by Google and the Google Play Store infrastructure.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Data collected by third-party providers (AdMob, Google Play Billing) is governed by their respective privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>
